This project contains a toolbox of Matlab simulation methods for computing the motion of hyper elastic materials undergoing large deformations.

The toolbox contain the most common physics-based animation methods used in the field of computer graphics.

The project aim is to make the theory and ideas accessible to a larger audience which may used the toolbox for prototyping own ideas or playing with simulation methods before adapting them into own code.
